All raw data was acquired and processed with our in-house software, SeroWare, which is soon-to-be-released as open-source as of June 2023. Until SeroWare is released, the processed data is provided in Excel sheet format.

Code for the PCR/PLSR analyses is provided in Jupyter Notebook format and written in Python. See publication for package and version information. Our recommendation is to install via Anaconda (see anaconda.com).
